        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a third year student taking Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). Having done my previous attachments at PCTL Automation and Central Electrical International Ltd. I have gained practical hands-on experience in electrical installation and power systems. 
I am hardworking and self-motivated towards achieving set goals and objectives. I’m also a self-driven person with ambitions in life and always looking for new challenges and dedicated toward achieving the best. My career ambition in electrical and electronic engineering has led me to take a short course in electrical installation as a stepping stone towards my dream career. I am time conscious, responsible, team player and a result-oriented person with the ability to work with minimum or no supervision
I am eager to gain more hands-on practical skills and also apply theoretical knowledge in a real life settng. Currently I am under a scholarship at PLP taking a course in Web development which so far has been great, I've learnt alot for the time I've been here.</p>
